_ATTENTION!
	cdxHUD is designed around competitive TF2. By downloading and using this HUD, you acknowledge and understand that certain gamemodes and items will not be supported.

_Beta Testers

	Please remember to keep your suggestions objective, rather than personal. It's not possible for me to customize every single person's HUD to their own liking.
	Although I will be providing a reasonable amount of customization instructions, suggestions such as "I don't like this font" and "x colour is ugly" will not be considered.
	
	However, suggestions that are more general or pertaining to visual clarity are more likely to be implemented. Examples of this are:
	"Can you include damage number customization?"
	"x background is too transparent, can you make that clearer?"
	
_Features

	cdxHUD was designed to have a stylish, but minimal design for clarity in the competitive 6v6 and 9v9 scenes.
	It removes visual clutter and emphasises elements that are important to gameplay.

	Inspired by the stylish visuals of EJP, the boldness of Garm3n 4MP, and the minimalism of oxide.

	In-game HUD:
		-Large Health, Ammo, and damage numbers for clarity
		-Subtle Overheal pulse
		-Attention-grabbing pulse for low ammo and health
		-Small, centered charge meters
		-Smaller kill feed

	Scoreboard:
		-Features both 9v9 and 6v6 format
		-Removes unimportant stats for less visual clutter
		-Large KDA numbers	
		-Player Deaths are highlighted in red, drawing more attention to how often the player is dying - This is scrapped for the time being, since the gun mettle update.

	Main Menu:
		-Your steam name featured at the top of the menu
		-Removal of less important buttons
		-Lovely background by KennyG6

	Make it your own:
		-Includes instruction to customize:
			*Colours of your damage numbers
			*Colours of your health/ammo
			*Shadow options for health and ammo numbers
			*And more, coming soon™
		
	Optimized:
		cdxHUD strives for clean code.
		Files are always checked for syntax errors, preventing possible stuttering that may occur as a result.
