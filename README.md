# cdxHUD
cdxHUD was designed to have a stylish, but minimal design for clarity in the competitive 9v9 and 6v6 scenes. It removes visual clutter and emphasises elements that are important to gameplay. 

Inspired by the stylish visuals of EJP, the Boldness of Garm3n 4MP, and the minimalism of oxide.

###Attention:
cdxHUD is designed around competitive TF2. By downloading and using this HUD, you acknowledge and understand that certain gamemodes and items will not be supported.
